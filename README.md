Trial App 

I used several tutorials on segues, steppers, and variabel storage from one view controller to another. I also 
did some general objectiv C tutorials because it's completely new to me. Xcode is usually very user friendly,
especially to beginners, but I found that was almost a problem as I could get through most of an app without
actually coding anything. By the time I actually needed to code I was so deep in the app I had absolutely no
idea what was going on. For this app I tried to use the storyboard editor only after I had written code that
it utilized because of the hand-holding.

The code in my project updates a value through a "stepper," displays that value, changes a text box based on
the value at the time a button is pressed, and moves to a new viewcontroller based on the value at the time a
button is pressed. There's also some code that unwinds to a previous viewcontroller, but it didn't really
involve any coding. 

The code as a whole lets the user tick a value up (or down) with a stepper. At any point while they're using 
the app they can check to see if they're "done." If they aren't, a message will pop up that tells them. If they
are, they'll be taken to a new screen that tells them they've finished! They can then navigate back to the
original screen.
